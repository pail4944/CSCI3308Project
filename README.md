##Description

Our goal for this project is to use the Yelp API to provide a rich individual experience through maps and graphs, including a more personalized approach to Yelp recommendations. 

##Vision Statement

"Helping you go where you wanna go"

##Motivation

Making a more personalized Yelp experience that allows users to save their favorite places and provides enhanced graphical fidelity and location visualization.

##Risks

-Breaking one of Yelp's API use guidelines (https://www.yelp.com/developers/display_requirements)

-Calling API too many times 

-Never collaborated on GitHub before (pail4944, anru9411)

###Mitigation Strategy

-Making sure we use Yelp's logos and buttons on every page

-Hopefully a low traffic count, bandwidth management

-Good communication through Slack, GitHub and Pivotal Tracker (pail4944)
